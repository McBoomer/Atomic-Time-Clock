Atomic Time is an exceptionally precise method of time-keeping that relies on the consistent and fundamental resonant frequencies of atoms, such as cesium-133, to define the standard unit of a second.
I created this clock to sync up exactly with that standard second. It displays my ability to take a simple thing like a clock and refine it to be the most accuratea and efficient form of itself.
I also included a hotkey in the program to allow the user to open a tab in their browser that shows the live exact atomic time and can be used to check the accuracy of the clock.
Although this is a simple GUI, the length and thickness of the hands, the trignometery that goes into the angle that the clock moves at and the anti aliasing filters on the shapes from the 'paintComponent' method
are all done by scratch. The dark mode is a feature that I personaly enjoy so I added it.

Thank you for checking out my application!
